# Week-4-Game

This is a game in which a random number is generated. Then random values are assigned to 4 jewels. jQuery is used so that every time a jewel is clicked, the value of a jewel is added to a total score. If the score goes above the randomly generated number the player loses. If the player's score equals the randomly generated number the player wins. When the player wins or loses, the game restarts and new numbers are generated.
